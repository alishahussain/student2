Depth and Details would be best added to an Issue that is linked from your blog.
### Depth would be adding feedback or thoughts you had for making things better.
- For my feature, it would go above and beyond to focus more on CRUD operations. Using my knowledge with CRUD and login/signup pages, I could apply It to my feature. In a professional site, there's always an option to remove a choice after adding it or edit to make changes. Incorporating this option would elevate the quality of my feature and provide users with a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
### Detail would be checkboxes or visual designs in the review ticket that represent work.
Plans for my Feature
- [x] add a "favorites" button in the navigation, with a page for all of the user's houses (frontend)
- [x] add a "favorite" button under each house option for the user to like, and move to the database (frontend)
- [ ] reformat using SASS to make the house page look better, move all the details to the right, and the favorite button so that the user doesn't have to scroll. (frontend)
- [x] add a new row to the real estate models API, about the favorites (backend)
- [x] add a function to add the selected house to the favorites page
- [x] ensure that the favorited house is unique to each user, and doesn't save for every one. 
- [x] link the endpoint of the API to the favorites page so all the houses will show up

### There could be one to many in Depth to Details.  For instance, Details may map more closely to work and one to many commits.  Also, Details could be assigned to different parties.
my key commits: [create favorites](https://github.com/Real-Estate-Analyzation/RealEstateFrontend/commit/70b062ec7ba64f891ee9ec78137f93affe2efbac), [fixed some errors](https://github.com/Real-Estate-Analyzation/RealEstateFrontend/commit/09c7e6e70cb115e2cacdc585b0390fcede9c4df3)

You could also map you CPT items into the discussion.  Collaboration with Sharon and others would be helpful.

If you did a quality job I would add up to 1 point on seed.  I am looking for good examples of taking feedback and collaborating on work.
