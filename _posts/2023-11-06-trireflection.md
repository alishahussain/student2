# <code style="color: #4e804f">☆ Unit 3 / Week 12 ☆</code>

During this trimester, I learned a great deal. When I came into this class, I had little knowledge of github, some knowledge of HTML CSS, and python. I felt really lost during the first few weeks, because I wasnt sure what was going on. I didn't understand the whole blog concept, and how we were going to document everything on this blog. It took me a little while to catch on, and install everything.
