# <code style="color: #4e804f">☆ Alisha's Blog ☆</code>
Hey, my name's Alisha, I'm a sophmore at Del Norte High School. I took AP CSP because I have always loved computer science, and have wanted to be a software engineer at google since I was 7. My two main interests are coding and biology, and I am also really fascinated with the medical field. Below is my about me image, and featured on it is the Pakistani flag, where I'm originally from, and NYC, where I lived for 6 years. I have a (poorly drawn lol) spotify logo because I love music, and a laptop with code because I really like to code. The whole blog is green, because that's my favorite color, so I wanted to apply that to this site.
